// Last Seed's HUD, drawn through SKSE Menu Framework's HUD API: four flat vertical bars (hunger, thirst, fatigue,
// vitality) in the same style as Frostfall's, stacked directly below Frostfall's group when Frostfall.dll's HUD is on.

	// Fade the Last Seed logo in and out (when Last Seed finishes starting).

	// SKSE Menu Framework's window is open.
